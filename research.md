Anthony Blaom has published work in both pure and applied Mathematics. 
Present research in **Differential Geometry** and **Lie theory** focuses on the
interplay between symmetry and geometric structure in the study of smooth
manifolds. Blaom has also made contributions to **Geometric
  Mechanics** (Hamiltonian systems with symmetry), **Hamiltonian
  Perturbation theory**, and on the chaotic advection of **Fluid
  Flows**.

Recently, Anthony has been intrigued by connections between
Differential Geometry and **Statistics**, as explored in relatively
new field called "Information Geometry".
