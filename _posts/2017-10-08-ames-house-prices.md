[Here](https://github.com/ablaom/AmesHousePrices/blob/master/README.md)
are some Julia notebooks where I train and compare a number of
different regression models that predict house prices in Ames,
Iowa. At time of writing, the best model places near the top 10% of
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
submissions on this well-studied data set.
