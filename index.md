Anthony Blaom carries out mathematics
[research]({{ base.url }}{% link research.md %})  and [data science consulting]({{ base.url
}}{% link datascience.md %}). He resides in Auckland, New Zealand.

Anthony was initially trained as a mechanical engineer, topping his
class at the University of Melbourne in 1991. After completing a
MSc in Aeronautics and a
PhD in Mathematics at Caltech in 1998, he joined the University of
Auckland as a Lecturer.  For a while he switched
to part-time teaching, focusing on his young children,
whom he homeschooled while living on the small island of Waiheke.

Anthony is a co-creator and the lead contributor to
[MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl), a Julia
machine learning palatform developed at the Alan Turing Institute,
London. While presently focused on data science, Anthony continues to
publish his research in peer-reviewed mathematics journals on a
semi-regular basis.
